# Description

The web has become a large and complex area for application
development. Access to an abundance of open source languages,
libraries, and frameworks has led to the quick and easy construction
of a variety of applications with several moving parts working in
coordination to present to the user the illusion of a single
program. In reality, web applications are extremely difficult to get
right. They involve a large collection of coordinated services,
multiple databases, complicated user interfaces, security and
performance issues, and ever changing 3rd party services, spread
across physical and virtual machines. These complications are further
stressed by the large number of concurrent users that access these
applications every second. This course will investigate several well
known web-based applications and the technology and software
architecture used to scale these applications. We will also study a
specific topic related to scalability in software design in the
context of web application architecture. This course counts as a CS
Elective toward the CS major (BA/BS) and as an Elective toward the
INFORM major. Prerequisites: COMPSCI 326. 3 credits.
